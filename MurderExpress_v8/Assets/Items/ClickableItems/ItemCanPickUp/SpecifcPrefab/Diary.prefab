    sentences:
    - "A couple pages seem to be dog eared, and you flip through them.\r\n6/3/--
      - It\u2019s finally happened! I\u2019ve finally gotten married to Dolofonia,
      my sweet sparrow. We even had our favorite drink at the wedding, which happens
      to share her pet name.  I want to write about every single day I get to spend
      with her along with writing my dreams."
    - 12/3 - The bond between us slowly deteriorated, and I did nothing to resolve
      it. I always needed to do what I needed to do in order to provide for us, but
      her desires compounded despite our dire poverty.
    - "12/5/1915 - It's been 10 years since that horrid day and the last time I picked
      this diary up. I didn\u2019t mean to, nor did I want to.  Can you forgive me,
      my little sparrow, after all this time? You were always so free-spirited--
      like you wanted to fly across the country. I\u2019ll realize the dream that
      you couldn\u2019t. "
    - "6/3/1920 -- After 5 long years, the Dolofonia is on its first trip today,
      marking our 31st wedding anniversary, and I should be happy, but I\u2019m constantly
      on edge. I'm trying to lock away everything I own.  Somehow *she* knows about
      what happened. What does she want fro..\r"
    - 'Start of Dream Diary:'
    - "6/3/ -- - My dream was rather strange last night:\r\nA cat comes back from
      hunting mice to a grimy alley, and brings a few grains for an injured sparrow
      to eat. The sparrow is bewildered and thankful.\r"
    - "11/28/ -- - It\u2019s been a while since I\u2019ve seen the sparrow and cat
      in my dreams:\r\nOne day, the sparrow grows tired of the grains and asks for
      berries, and then jam, then sweet bread; the cat complies with the harder requests
      each time, eventually failing when the sparrow asks for a pie.\r\n"
    - '12/15/05 -- This is my shortest dream with the cat and the sparrow:

      The
      cat called the sparrow, whose wing had healed, to follow it through the alley
      into the sewers. The pair traveled for a few days and eventually, the sparrow
      dropped to the ground from exhaustion. The cat quickly abandoned the sparrow.
